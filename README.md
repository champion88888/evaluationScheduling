**Pro Kabaddi Scheduling**

**Objective**

To build a java application to create double round robin scheduling for Pro Kabaddi Event

This is a small prototype of the application.

**Things Remaining**

1) Instead of using string in EventScheduler, use Match Class to return the objects.
2) Allow users to user filters, example, view information about specific match, matches on specfic day, matches of specific team.
